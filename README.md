### Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-10 Dataset

[üìÅ CNN_CIFAR10](https://github.com/caite21/Machine-Learning/blob/main/CNN_CIFAR10.ipynb)

This project trains CNNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 images, 10 classes) to optimize performance and enable user predictions.

**Highlights:**
- **Models Tested:** 5 variations, with 3-layer architectures showing the best generalization (up to 73% test accuracy). Dropout (50%) improves results.
- **Insights:** Pooling layers aid generalization; larger layers slightly boost accuracy. Training beyond 10 epochs has minimal impact.

**Try It:**

Download the pre-trained model (CNN_CIFAR10.keras) and use the provided notebook to predict custom 32x32 images.

**Images:**

**Example 1:**
A sample 32x32 image of an automobile was correctly classified as an automobile. The model's predictions, visualized in a bar plot, show high confidence for "automobile" with lower probabilities for "truck" and "boat," and minimal likelihood for any animal classes. This demonstrates the model's ability to distinguish vehicles from unrelated categories.

**Example 2:**
A 32x32 image of a horse was incorrectly classified as a deer, with "horse" as the second most likely prediction. The model confidently ruled out unrelated categories like "automobile." While not perfect, the prediction was reasonably close, highlighting areas for improvement in the model's accuracy.
